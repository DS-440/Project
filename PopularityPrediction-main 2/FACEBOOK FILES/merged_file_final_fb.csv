On the afternoon of Tuesday, 4 August, she was at home with her children when the two violent explosions hit the Lebanese capital. “We ran out of our home with nothing but our blood-stained clothes,” Rula says. “I was wounded, my daughter’s hand was broken, and my son was also hurt and he is still in pain. But I am thankful that we survived.” Rula spent the first night after the explosion at her brother’s house as the blast damaged three-quarters of her home. With support from volunteers and SOS Children’s Villages Lebanon, Rula and her children moved the next day to a temporary house where they can stay until it is safe for them to return home. The SOS team is contacting service providers to repair her house. Since the explosion, Carla Choueifaty, the SOS family strengthening coordinator in Beirut, has been in contact with families such as Rula’s to check on their needs. “The blast is catastrophic, too many people dead, wounded and disappeared. Everyone in Lebanon is affected in some way,” Carla says. “If the families we work with are good physically, this does not mean that they are good. Their relatives, friends and neighbors were hurt. The shock and the psychological effects on children and adults are significant. They all need psychological support,” she says.

On average, children only receive 4.5 years of schooling. 12% of babies are born with low birth weight. And 37% of children are affected by stunted growth. In Malawi, we have made significant progress in improving the nutritional status of the communities we work in; increasing access to education; promoting healthy behaviors among children and their caregivers; and empowering communities to become self-sustaining as they overcome poverty.

Communities around the world are still experiencing a shortage of healthcare workers and every eleven seconds a pregnant woman or newborn dies, mostly from preventable causes. Since COVID-19 many more newborn lives are at risk because of the increased lack of access to water, soap, vaccines and medicines that prevent diseases. As parents to a newborn, this breaks our hearts, as we empathize with struggling parents now more than ever. “As UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors, we know UNICEF is there, on the ground, doing whatever it takes to make sure every expecting mother has access to a trained health worker and access to quality healthcare. In celebration of the heart we know our daughter already has, we have set up a donation page to celebrate DDB’s arrival.

But the last few years have been harder than she could have ever imagined. “Our team never stopped teaching children, even under shelling,” says Alla, who works at a school near the ‘contact line’ in eastern Ukraine. “When they started firing, my students and I ran to hide. When it became safe, we sat down at desks again.” During heavy fighting and the COVID-19 lockdown, Alla has used every opportunity to stay in touch with her students. “When the COVID-19 pandemic started, we transferred all the classes to Zoom,” she says. “For me, one of the most important effects of the lockdown was that I was able to master the computer. But in addition to online lessons, I always tried to explain any difficult questions by phone, meet with parents and help with the installation of education software.” Although Alla has risen to the challenge, mathematics has been particularly difficult to teach online. She hopes the new school year will be easier. “I advise colleagues to always hope for the better and convey their optimism to children. You need to put on a mask, measure your temperature, use an antiseptic and come to students in a good mood. This year it is especially apparent how the children missed school, each another and their teachers during the lockdown. We missed them too.""",https://www.facebook.com/unicef/photos/a.10150563250124002/10158717624359002/?type=3,,,Photos from UNICEF's post,,,,,14.55,HIGH,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Antonio’s heartfelt wish came as a complete surprise today – a fleet of over a dozen Subaru vehicles from Subaru of America, Lester Glenn Subaru of Toms River and Subaru of Cherry Hill, led by the Camden County Police Department escort, drove past his home, each car carrying gifts that Antonio wished for during his virtual shopping spree just a few weeks prior. 
 
Antonio has struggled with his cancer diagnosis, news that devastated him and his family in April. He doesn’t fully understand his illness, but he has faced his challenges with a positive attitude and a smile, even when he must stay overnight at the hospital. For Antonio and his family, a wish-come-1 brings joy during a difficult time.
 
Antonio’s wish was granted thanks to the support of Subaru and the annual Share The Love Event. Since becoming a national charity partner beneficiary in 2011, Make-A-Wish America has received a total of more than $23 million in donations through the Subaru Share the Love Event. These funds have allowed more than 2,500 children nationwide to experience the power of a wish. Today, one more child was added to that number, as Antonio joined the Make-A-Wish family.

You are Not Alone

Hurricane Laura was upgraded to a cat 1 storm with the potential to intensify further to cat 3 prior to landfall early Thursday morning. The weather forecast is expecting Hurricane Laura to hit somewhere between Cameron, LA and Port Author, TX given its current track. Evacuations are taking place along a large swath of the Gulf Coast and low lying areas just inland.

Operation Compassion is currently contacting our disaster relief partners getting resources in place in response to this hurricane. Feed the Children, God’s Pit Crew, Mercy Chefs and others are involved in the planning and preparations. Several semi-trucks of bottled water, food, cleaning supplies, hygiene products and many other products necessary to help sustain survivors are staged and ready to be shipped.

We are also contacting disaster relief sites in the area to be prepared to help immediately after Hurricane Laura moves further inland. Operation Compassion will stay with the track of the storm providing relief help until the hurricane is no longer a threat.

Operation Compassion will need your help to meet the requests for assistance. Financial partners are vital for our continued relief efforts. It is easy to give online, by phone (debit/credit card), or through the mail. Become a financial partner with Operation Compassion! Before the storm, YOU are not alone!

You're not the only one. Months of physical distancing and seemingly endless lockdown measures, school closures and other sustained pressures have taken a toll on our mental health.⁣ ⁣ Reflect on exactly when you are feeling lonely and what seems to exacerbate it - like social media, grief, lack of sleep or stressful relationships. Lonely doesn’t just have to mean being alone – you can experience feelings of isolation even when surrounded by friends and family.⁣ ⁣ Take time to process your feelings. Set some time aside to disconnect from your phone or laptop, set-up a regular time for exercise, talk through your feelings with a friend or close family member, or try clear your mind with meditation. Loneliness is something that affects all of us from time to time but it’s something we rarely want to talk about. Seek additional support if you think your loneliness might be being caused or intensified by other conditions, such as depression or anxiety. Together, we can support each other through this.⁣ ⁣",https://www.facebook.com/unicef/photos/a.10150563250124002/10158753106809002/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.facebook.com%252Funicef%252Fphotos%252Fa.10150563250124002%252F10158753106809002%252F%253Ftype%253D3,,Timeline Photos,,,,,-1.65,HIGH,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Do not feel discouraged since there is no established path for you to walk on. You are creating it yourself. The way a person evolves is amazing. And how a girl grows into a woman is outstanding. Let your passions change as you learn. Your goals will be shaped by your passions and trust me, they will only get better. Your actions, your emotions, your courage, your passions, your thoughts, and the opportunities you seize will guide you to become the role model you will be. There is still a long way ahead of you, even ahead of me. As a girl and as a young woman, it is scary to think about it. But if your dreams don’t scare you, are they even worth pursuing? Yes, you are a girl. One girl turning into a woman. Feel honored to be one. Women are the epitome of “man”-kind. We are strong, we are smart, we can make our voices be heard, our actions be seen.

But Maria did. In the midst of a food crisis in Niger, Maria and her husband, a farmer and water merchant, were working long hours to put food on the table. But when there wasn’t any water to sell at the market and their crops were withering to dust, life was a daily struggle. With food and water shortages worsening, Maria’s 14-month-old daughter Fatchima grew frail and started getting sick after she began drinking water from the village well. As the weeks went on and Fatchima’s health worsened, Maria knew that her daughter’s survival was in jeopardy, so she took a brave step. She used a full day of her husband’s meager pay to hire a man with a motorcycle to drive them over treacherous dirt roads to reach the nearest Save the Children malnutrition unit. It was a decision that saved Fatchima’s life. Fatchima weighed just 11 pounds when she reached the malnutrition unit. Children 7 to 18 months old in Niger and other developing countries are most susceptible to acute malnutrition and waterborne illness, which makes them most vulnerable to rapid dehydration, infections and death. Thankfully, Fatchima’s story has a happy ending. She spent eight days at the malnutrition unit, growing stronger every day. When we checked in with Fatchima and Maria a year and a half later, Fatchima was strong and Maria was looking to the future. “We will send her to school, so that after her studies she can become a nurse or a teacher.” Today, 10 children around the world die from preventable causes like malnutrition every single minute. But you can help us create more happy endings like Fatchima’s. Please, donate if you can. To celebrate the giving season, your gift will be matched 3x to help three times as many children in need.

Daily life in their village now is tough. Getting food or water is very expensive and there are no schools or health facilities nearby.⁠ ⁠ Save the Children was able to provide the family with a sack of rice, beans, wheat flour and cooking oil. Before, they were only able to have two meals per day. Now, since Save the Children has helped them, they have three meals a day.⁠ ⁠ Although hardships remain, Anab is hopeful for a brighter future for her kids.⁠ ⁠ You can help.

At Make-A-Wish, it is only through our mosaic of different cultures, perspectives and experiences that we can grant life-changing wishes to every eligible child –including wish kid Zayden. Zayden, who was fascinated with outer space, wished to blast off to Saturn in a red rocket ship. Through virtual reality, his wish came 1 in 2017. For Zayden and many children like him, his wish was made possible by Make-A-Wish and the belief that nothing is impossible. Thanks to Black pioneers who have shaped U.S. history, including Guion “Guy” Bluford, the first Black American in space (1983) and Mae Jamison, the first Black woman in space (1992), wish kids like Zayden are empowered to dream big. This month, we are proud to celebrate the contributions that Black Americans have made to the success of our nation and our mission. 🚀 Learn more about Zayden’s wish at wish.org/zayden:=:https://wish.org/zayden.

After living on the streets of the capital, Abidjan, he travelled earlier this year to the town of San-Pedro. COVID-19 cases were just being reported in the country, and the resulting curfews made it even harder for those living on the streets to find enough food or money to survive. “At first, I wasn’t afraid of the disease itself, but I knew it would have an impact on us,” Béhé says. “During the curfew, I was often chased by armed men in the streets.” Béhé says it was a relief when he was approached by a social worker, who invited him to a UNICEF-supported child protection centre. “They gave me everything I needed to be able to protect myself against COVID-19,” he says. “I’m also getting counselling, and food and other support. The strict routine and numeracy classes at the centre have taken a bit of getting used to, but I feel like I have hope here. And I’m happy that I’m able to learn things that can help me in the future.” Interested in mechanics, Béhé wants to open his own garage one day. “I dream of my parents seeing me happy and being proud of me.”",https://www.facebook.com/unicef/photos/a.10150563250124002/10158952104589002/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Funicef%2Fphotos%2Fa.10150563250124002%2F10158952104589002%2F%3Ftype%3D3,,Timeline Photos,,,,,1.17,HIGH,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

""When I had children of my own, the memories of my childhood came flooding back. I chose to leave a gift to the NSPCC in my will because of my experiences as a child.” Rita was physically abused and neglected as a child by her mother. “She used to hit me all the time and for any reason. She even held a carving knife to my throat and threatened to kill me when I was 7 or 8.” When Rita was 21 she met her husband. “I hadn’t experienced love, so I was always surprised when people showed it to me. When I had children of my own, the memories of my childhood came flooding back. I was reminded of all the things my mother never did for me. The abuse affected me really badly - I feel like she took away my childhood. I might not ever see the difference that my gift is making but I know I’m doing something, and it feels great.” Rita is incredible and has left a gift in her Will to the NSPCC.

I remember a lot of mixed emotions. You hear all these stories of what can go wrong during pregnancy.” It was Graham’s first time becoming a dad, and he went along to the appointments with his partner to prepare. “I was too nervous to ask questions. I didn’t want it to seem like I didn’t know what I was doing. I felt that I was just expected to stand in the corner during appointments; there but not involved. I stopped talking about my feelings to anyone.” After Graham’s daughter Roxy was born, he continued to struggle with his mental health. “Our check-ups after Roxy arrived felt the same as before. I was never asked how I was feeling or if I had questions. You see on TV that people with mental health struggles can have their kids taken off them, so I was worried that if I did speak to our Health Visitor about it, that they might pass this on to someone who would decide I wasn’t fit to keep my child.” Not getting support made it a lot harder for him to get settled into his new role as a dad. “My partner and I separated when Roxy was six months old and it was a difficult time. My mental health really took a turn for the worse. Over time I began having suicidal thoughts.” Graham was referred to Blackpool Better Start, and did a support course called ‘Mellow Dads.’ “It's important dads speak up about their mental health. Even just talking really helps. I want to help other dads and I think it’s important to build better bonds with professionals who support parents so we can work together to change dads’ experiences.""

Once she arrived, things seemed fine at first, but then it began getting difficult again.” Tayah felt overwhelmed with the new challenge of being a mum: “It started to sink in that she was mine and that this was 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with no breaks.” In England, healthcare professionals check in with all parents in the first few months to spot the signs of mental health problems and support them to bond with their baby. They are crucial for mums like Tayah who’ve needed help. “That black cloud that created a storm in my life soon passed and perhaps could have passed even sooner if I had gotten the help I needed.” With added pressures of the pandemic, we’re asking the government to ensure parents continue to get the support they need.

I love the NSPCC because they really look after families and I think that is so important especially nowadays when we are going through such difficult times. This last year the NSPCC has worked wonders and I’m really grateful to them.” Since the age of 95, Anne has hosted an annual garden party at her home with the help of friends, family and NSPCC volunteers, and guests have even included Childline Founder Dame Esther Rantzen. Each event has raised vital funds, helping us to be here for children who’ve needed us over the years. However, large gatherings out of the question last year because of the pandemic, but Anne didn’t let that stop her. Instead she set up a Just Giving Page for those who would have attended the event, and raised nearly £4,000! Anne was invited to join her local NSPCC committee over six decades ago, and has been involved in a wide range of different fundraising events and initiatives over that time. We thank Anne from the bottom of our hearts for so many decades of loyal support. Anne is an inspiration to us all, her smile lights up any room and her caring for children everywhere is appreciated.

Emotional abuse is any type of abuse that involves the continual emotional mistreatment of a child. Emotional abuse can involve deliberately trying to scare, humiliate, isolate or ignore a child. Emotional abuse is often a part of other kinds of abuse, which means it can be difficult to spot the signs or tell the difference, though it can also happen on its own. Any child, from any background, can be at risk of emotional abuse so it's important to stay informed and be able to spot the signs. If you're worried about a child you know, we're here to help.

It was the listening ear that was able to get Victoria to where she is now. Being able to open up to someone actually saved her.” Through volunteering, Lisa was able to gain additional knowledge and skills to help her daughter cope. “It’s the fact that Victoria has come through the other side.

Megan’s step-grandfather didn’t look after her like he should have. Instead, he sexually abused her from the age of four until 11. After enduring years of abuse, she told her parents to try to protect her younger siblings. “When I was 11-years-old, I really didn’t want to be alive. I felt I couldn’t go on anymore and I needed to tell someone. I was also getting frightened that he would potentially abuse my sisters. When he would help to bath them I would stand and watch him through the crack in the door to check they were safe. I credit my sisters with saving my life, because I wouldn’t have come forward if it wasn’t for them. There was no way I was ever going to let him abuse them. The only thing I had to hold on to after the abuse, was at least it was me and not them.” The abuse has had serious consequences on Megan’s mental health. “I started self-harming and made two suicide attempts when I was ten-years-old. I’ve suffered with panic attacks and depression for years. At the age of 27 I was diagnosed with complex PTSD and then dissociative disorder which means that I suffer from a series of PNES which are ‘psychological non epileptic seizures’ brought on by high levels of stress and anxiety. These are physical fits where I drop to the floor, they can easily last up to two hours and have at times lead me to be hospitalised. As well the physical factors of living with trauma, mentally it affects every aspect of my life and makes any type of relationship difficult. I want to share my story because seeing others share theirs, is what gave me the courage to come forward. I would like others to understand complex PTSD and other mental health disorders.” Megan had support from the NSPCC as a child and mental health support as an adult. She went back to the police to re-open her case, and sent her abuser to prison for 18 years, meaning Megan was able to begin her journey of recovery. #ItsNotOk",https://www.facebook.com/nspcc/photos/a.226420869851/10161698912724852/?type=3,,"""Abuse became my new normal"" Megan",Timeline Photos,,,,,2.74,HIGH,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

It’s nothing to do with children in general, it’s how I feel about myself."" Gary struggled with his mental health when he became a father, and he isn't alone. Up to 1 in 10 dads in the UK experience mental health issues during pregnancy and after birth. Access to emotional and psychological support during pregnancy and after birth is vital for all parents. Gary was put in touch with a group called the Dad’s Project, and he's found additional support through social media. ""I know my father, growing up, he just wouldn’t talk. I’ve found there’s a few pages on social media where men will talk. If you can sit at home and talk to someone, it’s a lot easier than having to drive half an hour to go see somebody. It feels like a relief but we still worry that this person will now know all of our problems. Just because you have a mental health problem, doesn’t mean there’s something really bad or wrong with you. Accept help. If someone offers it to you it’s because they care. If you’re struggling, just be open and honest and say, I’m really struggling."" Right now, getting the right support at the right time isn’t guaranteed. That's why our Fight for a #FairStart campaign is calling on governments across the UK to help parents, like Gary, make sure mental health support is in place at every stage throughout pregnancy and after birth – from the first check-up through to specialist help if needed.

At the same time, I felt lost. It was confusing; I had all the positives about having a new baby on the one hand but the stress and ongoing feeling of being dismissed as a ‘paranoid’ new mum alongside this. I’d been so anxious towards the end of my pregnancy that I often struggled to get out of bed."" When Jasmine brought her son home, she noticed he was vomiting more than usual, but struggled to get medical support. ""My son was finally diagnosed with severe reflux, as well as cows’ milk and soya allergies. As a result of how my concerns had been dismissed I became very protective and anxious when it came to my son. All I wanted was to be able to celebrate being a mum. I became pregnant with my second baby seven months after my first and, following my previous experiences still didn’t feel able to enjoy pregnancy the way I’d hoped to."" After struggling to get medical support for her son, Jasmine met her Health Visitor Wendy, who she thanks for supporting her throughout her pregnancies. ""Wendy is an amazing human being. She told me I was doing really well, reassured me and encouraged me. Her visit made me feel happy and confident. I think if I hadn’t been able to get to know her and build that bond, my anxiety would have worsened. I was able to be honest with her and that made a huge difference. When I’d struggled with my feelings before, I’d never told people. It was a hard thing to do, so it had to be with someone like Wendy who I felt comfortable with and came to know well.

Trigger warning: self-harm and eating disorders. ""A group of girls I was friends with turned on me overnight. It escalated to online bullying, then a boy started physically bullying me. My mum knew that I was suffering from anxiety and not eating properly. What they didn’t know was that I was self-harming. To help me cope I often visited Childline and chatted to online counsellors."" Megan's parents eventually found out about her self-harming and got her professional help. ""I told my parents I couldn’t deal with the bullying, so I moved schools. My first day was nerve wracking but everyone was really nice and there was a frenzy of people adding me on social media. I ended up adding a boy who was a year above me. He started messaging me on Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. Then one night he asked me if I would send him a picture of myself naked. I said no. For four days it was constant pressure. I was desperate to be liked so in the end I sent him an image of me naked via Snapchat. A message appeared. It was a photo of a girl in my year group with the words ‘Haha I’ve got you’. She had taken a photo of the image I had sent on her phone and had been using the boy’s social media accounts to communicate with me. I panicked and turned my phone off. The next morning I had loads of text messages. I ignored them and went to school but as soon as I arrived people started crowding round me holding up their phones with the photo of me on the screen and print outs of it."" As a result, Megan began to struggle with her mental and emotional health again. ""I started self-harming again, not eating properly and isolating myself. I turned to Childline to help me cope. I truly believe if it wasn’t for Childline I wouldn’t be here today."" Megan is working hard to raise awareness around the pressures of sexting. ""Life is good now. I give talks about my ordeal at schools, charity and government events and police training sessions to help them understand how best to handle cases similar to mine. Even if I can help just one person through everything that I do then it’s worth it."" All young people, like Megan have the right to be safe online from sexual abuse.

That was the first time I called Childline. The counsellor started asking me about the things I like to do. Afterwards I was able to talk calmly about what had happened. That chat stopped me from going back to my room and trying again.” Hollie, struggled with her mental health and after she suffered a panic attack, within a matter of months she had deteriorated so much she had dropped out of school, isolated herself from her friends and been admitted to hospital. When she turned to Childline, our counsellors were there to listen and help her. “When I was back at home, I still wasn’t talking to people but whenever I was feeling low I would go to the shed and call Childline – they were the only people I would speak to. Childline gave me the confidence to write a note to my mum asking if I could see a counsellor. It was that counsellor who, after two and half years of silence, finally got me talking again. If I hadn’t called Childline there is a chance I wouldn’t be here today. In fact, all the progress I have made is thanks to other people’s support, including Childline.” Our Childline volunteers are the beating heart of what we do and without them, we couldn’t help children and young people like Hollie, who need us.

Children have a right to know no one should ever take a picture of them in their underwear, or nude. MAMA EFFECT S BEAR",The Mama Bear Effect,"I am posting this with the hope that every parent, caregiver, grandparent, babysitter, etc. understands how serious this message is for the safety of children. 

While we know that images of child sexual abuse have sky-rocketed in distribution over recent years, much of it being shared through social media, we also know something equally disturbing . 

The vast majority of people who exploit children online are parents, stepparents, and people who LIVE within the same home as the child. 

I came across a news story this evening that I will not share because it will be very triggering for many, but this epidemic is not going away, if anything, I fear it is getting worse. 

Teach children as soon as they are able to understand, that they have a right to say 'no' to being photographed. Children are photographed more than any other generation - while this is a benefit to parents who want to be able to capture every moment, children are also normalizing having every moment of their day captured and also shared on social media. 

Teach children that NO ONE should take a picture of them when they are not fully dressed. It may seem harmless to take photos of them in the bath, on the toilet or running around in underwear, but the rate we are learning children, especially young children exploited is at the point we should be considering child sexual abuse a national emergency. 

These children often have no idea that what is happening to them is wrong, and these predators are smart enough to take steps that make it very difficult to track them down. 

This has to become a movement, because we the good people of this earth have the most opportunity to protect children, with awareness and care for the people we know to educate them on this risk. This is not a ""parent"" issue this is an everyone issue - if you know children, make sure they know their rights - if their own parent is abusing them, it's that much harder for them to disclose and get help. But with the knowledge that they can get help to make it stop, we can help stop abuse from continuing. 

There are no guarantees, there are no fail-safe methods, but we cannot let this devastation of innocent life go on without doing what we can to stop it. 

When people sexually violate a child, they also violate the trust of the other adults who desire to protect that child, their faith and goodness is also exploited. 

People may attack us and say we're infringing on the rights of parents to take photos of their children as they see fit, but we urge you to consider the underlying message children are hearing when we don't respect their privacy and their desire to not be photographed. Imagine if we did the same to another adult? Imagine if another person took and shared pictures of us without our consent? 

Children are citizens of this world and by their innocence, they require more protections for their rights, not less.

Today we're giving the mic to some of the amazing women in our team who will share words about work/life balance, challenges during the pandemic and more!

Meet our very powerful Procurement Officer, Mona Saad

""I've been working at Tdh for 19 years, it used to be very hard to balance work and life because I used to travel a lot in my early years. But now since I got married and had kids, I have a clear system to organize myself. I wake up at 6 am to prepare my children's meals, then I go to work and when I get back I have to do the same to make sure that they're fed and doing their homework. 

My job is very challenging but very rewarding at the same time, one time years ago I received a call of appreciation from the Minister's secretariat of the Ministry of Justice, this made me feel that my hard work pays off. During the pandemic, its exceptionally hard when my kids have exams because I have to make sure they're safe when they go to their lessons.

Work means a lot to me, and specially working in development, hearing the stories of people, this gives me strength and makes me feel like I'm in the right place, the smiles of children and youth I met, all this gives me purpose and drive. I remember I used to cry a lot when I heard the stories of children we worked with, but then I realized that tears won't help make anything change, hard work will. So this powers me to be able to do all this work.

I think the only way to be able to balance work and life is to choose a job that is fulfilling to us, I want to encourage people and women who are worried about working in development. I want to say that it is a very rewarding field and it will give you strength, faith and purpose that you never imagined""

Terre des hommes Ηellas  - Γη των ανθρώπων set up these spaces, which are based on the FabLab model, in refugee camps and safe zones in the Attica region to support the wellbeing of refugee children and youth.

🧵 Here, children and young people learn how to use sewing machines, laser cutters and 3D printers to make masks, visors and other protective equipment that will be distributed amongst their community, as well as to the frontline workers.  

🆒 They will also create clothes, toys, fitness equipment, gardening tools and anything else they can imagine to meet the needs and desires of the people living in the camps. 

🧘 At the same time, the ConstrAct Lab participants will attend our informative and creative activities to learn how to stay safe during the pandemic, but also how to manage its effects on their mental health, which unfortunately, keeps worsening due to their particular living conditions.     

💪 The children hosted in the Schisto Safe Zone already had the opportunity to get acquainted with the sewing machines and choose the fabric they liked to create their own mask, step by step.
✅ Of course, we followed the specifications set by the World Health Organization (WHO), so our masks have 3 layers of fabric of different composition to provide the maximum possible protection from COVID-19. 

👖 During the workshop, the children could also repair their clothes using our FabLab equipment. 

🙌 Those who were already familiar with the use of sewing machines were happy to reconnect with an activity they love, and they willingly helped others and contributed to the conduct of the workshop. The ones who were new to this activity found the challenge and experience enjoyable and want to do it again!  

🤩 However, the best thing about our meetings is what we share and how this makes the children's time really count. They get to know each other better, they feel creative, they relax with music and tea and… they are looking forward to the next time!

❗️ One million Syrian children were born as refugees since 2011. 🇬🇷 Among them are the three children of Nasrin, 29, a Syrian woman who lives in the Veria refugee camp in Greece. Nasrin’s older daughter of 5 years never spoke due to trauma. 

🧡 Read the story of Nasrin and her family to learn about the difficulties they went and go through, their memories of Syria, and hopes for a peaceful and healthy future. 

🤲 In Veria, as well as in seven other mainland camps, Terre des hommes Ηellas  - Γη των ανθρώπων offers child protection services and works to ensure that families receive support and children grow up in the best possible conditions.

🗣 ""My name is Nasrin, I am 29 years old and I am a recognized refugee from Syria. I have been in Greece for two years now with my three children and my husband who is also a Syrian refugee. We did not come to Greece directly from Syria, but from Kurdish Iraq where we lived in a camp with my husband and where my first daughter, who is now 5 years old, was born. My other two children are 3 years and 9 months old.

Life was very difficult in post-war Syria. There was no safety in our village – near the town of Qamishli on the borders with Turkey. It was abandoned by its residents and it was impossible to find work, everything became very expensive, we had to leave. It was a difficult journey, and the situation was aggravated by the fact that our families did not want this marriage. We had to get married against their will and hide because my brother was threatening to kill me. We had to live all alone for a long time in a forest, without electricity, to stay alive. But even after the child was born, we were left alone in the woods, surviving only on some bread. In these circumstances, I lost a pregnancy due to miscarriage. I did not even know I was pregnant.

We passed from Turkey to Lesvos island in Greece and stayed at the Moria camp in a tent with two blankets. We slept on a wooden pallet and so I got problems with my back. Then we moved to Veria, to this camp where mainly Syrians, recognized refugees, live. We are currently waiting for our travel documents to be processed, in order to leave for Germany.

I have pinned all my hopes on this journey. I wish to be in a house, so that I and my family can rest. But most of all, I am hoping for a cure for my daughter, who never spoke. She was eight months old when we left the forest and went to live in a village, in a ruin, before ending up in a camp in Iraq. When she was 2 years old, we found out that she could not speak. She is now 5, and the problem has not yet been remedied. Her mental state is very bad. She cries, takes off her clothes, does not eat, does not play.

I hope that with the help of our relatives who live in Germany, my brother-in-law and my uncle, we will be able to access treatment. My husband in Syria worked at the market, sometimes selling vegetables, sometimes doing small chores. I hope he will find something to do to earn a living. I have worked as a child, with my father, in the fields.

Although things in Greece are better than before, you cannot call it a normal life. The fatigue is intense, the routine too, we sit all day in our container without being able to do anything. Living in such a small space with three children is very difficult, not only now, because of the pandemic, but it has been like this ever since we came.

I miss Syria and my village very much. When I left, I took some photos from when I was a child and the place where we lived. I think about it and tears come to my eyes. But the photos were left behind in Iraq, and now I miss them so much, it was the only thing I had to remember what I left behind. I miss my family too. My two brothers, with whom our relationship has been restored, are both disabled, and my father is blind. All of them are left behind, refugees in Iraq.

Terre des hommes has helped us a lot. They supported us in our effort to gain access to the local hospital for my baby who has trouble with movement and also covered medical expenses with private doctors, and also with my older daughter: Tdh psychologist is offering her mental health and psychosocial support sessions that are very helpful and contributed a lot to improving her condition. They also helped us with baby milk and medicine. Additionally, Tdh legal team offered us counselling to tackle procedures that were necessary. May we find similar support when we reach our destination.

I talk to my children about Syria, I tell them about my village and their grandparents. But they are still too young, they cannot understand. I do not care about anything, not even the pandemic, all I care about is for my daughter to get well, to be (truncated)",,,,1.97,HIGH,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

Life loves colour and colour is very much needed in the grey refugee camps. 🇬🇷 This is why our team in the open accommodation site in Koutsochero, Greece, decided to transform the dull cement corridors that facilitate the access of people with mobility impairments and of parents carrying prams.

🤩 To make the way to our offices a bit more fun, we painted a hopscotch playground as bright as could be. Since that day, the bland corridor has been all about laughing and playing and loved by children as well as by adults who feel like children.
 
🙌🏾 Even small things like this help at least 40 families build resilience and keep their hope for a better life. Our teams also provide these families with psychosocial and legal support within the framework of our child protection project.

The tournament is part of our joint project titled 'Using Kabaddi to empower girls at risk of or affected by unsafe migration in West Bengal, India' where the main objective is to use Sport as a tool to empower and raise girls’ confidence so that they can make safer choices, whereby they can ultimately work towards creating a future they want to lead, which is void of child marriage, child labour, gender based violence and trafficking.

On Friday we were able to launch the 'Kabaddi for Protection Model’ which is an adaptation/contextualization of Tdh’s global Sports for Protection methodology. This methodology will be available and open source to all stakeholders and partners working in this space. 

In the Tournament the Siliguri team took home the Champions cup, however each of these girls are winners in their own rights and we couldn't be more proud of their determined and feisty approach to life.

📲 Priya is a champion of our project that improves primary healthcare and #Covid19 diagnosis in rural areas through a mobile application on digital tablets. Within just one month, she was able to screen 2155 patients by using the application. 

🧡 Priya is passionate about strengthening access of the community to the public health system. She was excited to share her achievements and story within this project: 

🗣 ""Every morning I travel a long distance from my house to reach the health centre. Working as a healthcare worker in the last 12 years has helped me to understand the culture, perceptions and real needs of the community in Namkum. I am an honest worker and committed to my job, despite the many hurdles I am faced with. One of my biggest challenges has been maintaining hard copies of patient reports, and this challenge was further increased when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. 

This project has given me the opportunity for varied trainings and coaching support, which has been very encouraging and motivating. Being able to register and capture patients details digitally, with such ease, uniformity and efficiency has been a great support and addressed one of my great challenges of hardcopy data management. The innovative applications are helping me to reach more patients then I did previously, and I am able to revisit patient records, which earlier was not possible. Within one month I was able to screen 2155 patients while using the application. I am very proud of this achievement.""

ℹ Our project titled ""Digital Health Innovation for COVID-19 response in India"" is implemented with the generous funding from TaiwanICDF財團法人國際合作發展基金會. The project is being piloted in three selected blocks of Ranchi district in collaboration with our partner Doctors For You  (DFY) and with support from the National Health Mission, Government of Jharkhand.

Waste water is collected in a tank and then automatically filtered by a membrane. The system works by gravity. The technology enables water to be recycled without the use of electricity, without any complex maintenance and without a continuous supply of chemical products. The filtration membrane is so fine that it does not let bacteria or viruses pass through. Water for washing hands flows by means of a foot pump. “Washing hands reduces 50% of cases of diarrhoea and pneumonia among young children and restricts to a great extent the spread of infectious diseases and epidemics such as cholera and Ebola. Gravit’eau was developed to be a simple to use solution”, explains Bruno Pascual, our expert in water, sanitation and hygiene in emergency situations. #GlobalHandwashingDay 🔗 www.tdh.ch/en/projects/graviteau-washing-your-hands-recycled-water:=:https://www.tdh.ch/en/projects/graviteau-washing-your-hands-recycled-water",https://www.facebook.com/tdh.ch/photos/a.148701821833168/3347175408652444/?type=3,,,,,,,,1.59,HIGH,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

This week, we will share with you how, during the past two years, we helped Roma migrant children to have access to non-discriminatory education in Romania, France, and Spain. At least 90% of Roma people in Romania live in poverty. To improve their situation, many families often choose to go abroad for some time. France and Spain are among their main destination countries. Ethnic discrimination is one of the children’s many problems, as are poverty or lack of housing, food, clothes, transportation, access to Internet and to public services. More than 50% of the Roma migrant children are not enrolled in school. Children face adaptation and integration difficulties both in the new country and when they return to Romania. Through our project, teachers, students, parents and child protection professionals from Romania, France and Spain have united their voices into one, saying “MISTO AVILEAN!” (“Welcome!”, in Romani language) to Roma children.

In our international project “MISTO AVILEAN!”, we trained 450 teachers in Romania, France, and Spain to provide culturally sensitive and adapted content and to use interactive inclusive methods. Teachers learned about Roma identity, their culture and social organisation, anti-Roma prejudice, the school-family rupture, and national and EU anti-discrimination legislation. Together with our partners, we have also created an international online platform, where more than 300 teachers from 40 schools in the three countries can communicate and collaborate, exchange experience and good practices.

We encouraged and helped teachers in Romania, France, and Spain to understand Roma culture and connect with Roma parents, so that they all team up for the best interest of the child. “If you invite parents and children to your office, you have won their trust. It means you have treated them with respect. They are your equal. They will return this respect”, said a school director in Romania, who believes it is important to establish a relationship of trust and open communication. “Once Roma families decide to migrate, we need to keep in touch with parents and other schools, so that we are aware of the situation and development of the child while abroad.

Tdh entwickelt zudem die Kompetenzen von lokalen Organisationen, von Angehörigen der Gemeinschaften und Behörden, um eine nachhaltige Wirkung zu erzielen. #Syria10 🙏🏼 Spenden Sie, um Kinder und ihre Familien zu unterstützen, die vom Krieg in Syrien betroffen sind. www.tdh.ch/spenden/syrien:=:https://www.tdh.ch/de/nous-soutenir/donner/urgence?urgence=19251&montant=50",https://www.facebook.com/tdh.ch/photos/a.148701821833168/3748526108517370/?type=3,,"#SYRIA10 12 Millionen Menschen wurden gezwungen, ihr Zuhause zu verlassen",,,,,,-5.88,HIGH,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Αυτή την εβδομάδα συνολικά 27 μητέρες και φροντιστές παιδιών που διαμένουν στη δομή του Σκαραμαγκά είχαν τη δυνατότητα να παρακολουθήσουν τη συνεδρία ενημέρωσης από την ψυχολόγο μας, Νασρίν Aχμάντι, σχετικά με την εκπαίδευση τουαλέτας για παιδιά 0-6 ετών, αλλά και για ζητήματα που αφορούν στη νυχτερινή ενούρηση και στους τρόπους αντιμετώπισης της και αναζήτησης υποστήριξης,  για παιδιά όλων των ηλικιών.

🆘Η εκπαίδευση τουαλέτας είναι ένα πολύ σημαντικό ορόσημο της παιδικής ηλικίας, που σχετίζεται και επηρεάζει όλη τη μετέπειτα ψυχοκοινωνική εξέλιξη του παιδιού, κυρίως σε ό,τι αφορά στην ανάπτυξη της αυτονομίας και της ελεύθερης βούλησης. 

🌞Στη διάρκεια της συνάντησης και μέσα από διαδραστικές ασκήσεις, οι μητέρες εμπλούτισαν τις γνώσεις τους για τα ορόσημα στην ανάπτυξη του παιδιού, ενημερώθηκαν για πρακτικούς τρόπους με τους οποίους μπορούν να βοηθήσουν οι ίδιες τη διαδικασία στα πλαίσια της διαβίωσής τους μέσα στους καταυλισμούς, να μάθουν να αναγνωρίζουν το σημείο όπου είναι απαραίτητη η συμβολή του ειδικού,  αλλά και να ενισχυθούν στο ρόλο τους ως γονέων και φροντιστών.

🌞Η εκπαίδευση τήρησε  όλα τα μέτρα προστασίας από τον Covid19, και στο τέλος, στις συμμετέχουσες προσφέραμε βοηθητικά καθίσματα τουαλέτας για τα παιδιά τους.

🎯Στο Σκαραμαγκά, όπως και σε 8 άλλες περιοχές της ηπειρωτικής Ελλάδας, οι ομάδες μας παρέχουν υπηρεσίες παιδικής προστασίας σε ανοιχτές δομές φιλοξενίας αιτούντων άσυλο και προσφύγων σε οικογένειες με παιδιά, σε συνεργασία με την DRC Greece, τον IOM Greece και με την υποστήριξη του Ταμείου για το Άσυλο, τη Μετανάστευση και την Ένταξη #AMIF της Ευρωπαϊκής Ένωσης #DGHOME #EUHomeAffairs  🇪🇺

Θα θέλαμε να ευχαριστήσουμε την οργάνωση Dråpen i Havet (Drop in the Ocean) για τη φιλοξενία και τη συνεργασία τους στην ενημέρωση και την εγγραφή των γονέων στην ομάδα μας.",,,,-1.81,HIGH,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Nous avons commencé à travailler dans les camps, les communautés d’accueil et sur les routes migratoires en fournissant notamment du matériel de première nécessité, du soutien psychologique d’urgence, et en créant des espaces dédiés aux enfants. Au fil du temps et de l’évolution du conflit, les besoins des enfants et des familles changent et de nouvelles problématiques émergent. En collaboration avec des partenaires locaux, nos équipes travaillent avec les enfants, les familles réfugiés et les communautés d’accueil pour faire respecter les droits des enfants. Ensemble, nous luttons contre les impacts négatifs de cette crise humanitaire, comme la pauvreté, la violence, l’exploitation des enfants, le mariage précoce, la déscolarisation. Terre des hommes développe également les compétences des organisations locales, des membres des communautés et des autorités pour un impact durable.

Wir begannen, in Flüchtlingslagern, in den Aufnahmegemeinschaften und auf den Migrationsrouten zu arbeiten, wobei wir insbesondere Güter des täglichen Bedarfs und psychologische Soforthilfe bereitstellten und spezielle Räume für Kinder schufen. Im Laufe der Zeit und der Entwicklung des Konflikts verändern sich die Bedürfnisse von Kindern und Familien und es tauchen neue Probleme auf. In Zusammenarbeit mit lokalen Partnern arbeiten unsere Teams mit den Kindern, den Flüchtlingsfamilien und den Aufnahmegemeinschaften, um zu gewährleisten, dass die Kinderrechte eingehalten werden. Zusammen mit ihnen bekämpfen wir die negativen Auswirkungen dieser humanitären Krise: Armut, Gewalt, Ausbeutung von Kindern, Kinderehen, Schulabbruch. Tdh entwickelt zudem die Kompetenzen von lokalen Organisationen, von Angehörigen der Gemeinschaften und Behörden, um eine nachhaltige Wirkung zu erzielen.

Our project ""Accelerate Release of Children; Protect Children from COVID-19"" is running for the World Justice Project's Challenge.

Children and youth are entitled to fundamental rights including the right to have access to justice. Yet, many of them face challenges accessing this right, a situation that has been worsened with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Tdh's project ""Accelerate Release of Children; Protect Children from COVID-19"" is the only project submitted to the World Justice Challenge 2021 linked to the rights of children and young people. As they make up nearly half of the world's population, we must take more action to ensure the realisation of their fundamental rights.

At the beginning, our team noticed that he was always alone and didn’t want to play with the other children. “After some time, I became friends with Arshad and Saber [two Tdh staff] and started trusting them.

Χρειάζεται όλοι να συνεργαστούμε για να μηδενίζουμε αυτόν τον αριθμό. #worldchildrensday #nochildalone",https://www.facebook.com/HomeProjectOrg/photos/a.1582650538429714/4173720702656005/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.facebook.com%252Flogin%252F%253Fnext%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.facebook.com%25252Flogin%25252F%25253Fnext%25253Dhttps%2525253A%2525252F%2525252Fwww.facebook.com%2525252Flogin%2525252F%2525253Fnext%2525253Dhttps%252525253A%252525252F%252525252Fwww.facebook.com%252525252Flogin%252525252F%252525253Fnext%252525253Dhttps%25252525253A%25252525252F%25252525252Fwww.facebook.com%25252525252Flogin%25252525252F%25252525253Fnext%25252525253Dhttps%2525252525253A%2525252525252F%2525252525252Fwww.facebook.com%2525252525252Flogin%2525252525252F%2525252525253Fnext%2525252525253Dhttps%252525252525253A%252525252525252F%252525252525252Fwww.facebook.com%252525252525252Flogin%252525252525252F%252525252525253Fnext%252525252525253Dhttps%25252525252525253A%25252525252525252F%25252525252525252Fwww.facebook.com%25252525252525252Flogin%25252525252525252F%25252525252525253Fnext%25252525252525253Dhttps%2525252525252525253A%2525252525252525252F%2525252525252525252Fwww.facebook.com%2525252525252525252FHomeProjectOrg%2525252525252525252Fphotos%2525252525252525252Fa.1582650538429714%2525252525252525252F4173720702656005%2525252525252525252F%2525252525252525253Ftype%2525252525252525253D3,,,,,,,-1.62,HIGH,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Σε μια προσπάθεια να παρέχουν ασφαλές περιβάλλον για τα παιδιά που βρίσκονται στην Ελλάδα μόνα τους, το Movement On The Ground και το HOME Project συνεργάζονται για το άνοιγμα και τη λειτουργία τριών ξενώνων για ασυνόδευτα παιδιά στην Αθήνα. #nochildalone",https://www.facebook.com/HomeProjectOrg/photos/a.1582650538429714/4194208373940571/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.facebook.com%252Flogin%252F%253Fnext%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.facebook.com%25252Flogin%25252F%25253Fnext%25253Dhttps%2525253A%2525252F%2525252Fwww.facebook.com%2525252Flogin%2525252F%2525253Fnext%2525253Dhttps%252525253A%252525252F%252525252Fwww.facebook.com%252525252Flogin%252525252F%252525253Fnext%252525253Dhttps%25252525253A%25252525252F%25252525252Fwww.facebook.com%25252525252Flogin%25252525252F%25252525253Fnext%25252525253Dhttps%2525252525253A%2525252525252F%2525252525252Fwww.facebook.com%2525252525252Flogin%2525252525252F%2525252525253Fnext%2525252525253Dhttps%252525252525253A%252525252525252F%252525252525252Fwww.facebook.com%252525252525252Flogin%252525252525252F%252525252525253Fnext%252525252525253Dhttps%25252525252525253A%25252525252525252F%25252525252525252Fwww.facebook.com%25252525252525252Flogin%25252525252525252F%25252525252525253Fnext%25252525252525253Dhttps%2525252525252525253A%2525252525252525252F%2525252525252525252Fwww.facebook.com%2525252525252525252FHomeProjectOrg%2525252525252525252Fphotos%2525252525252525252Fa.1582650538429714%2525252525252525252F4194208373940571%2525252525252525252F%2525252525252525253Ftype%2525252525252525253D3,,,,,,,-2.52,HIGH,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In 1874, eight-year-old Mary Ellen was being severely abused and neglected by her foster parents. A missionary worker, Etta Wheeler, brought the case to the local police, who refused to intervene. Wheeler persisted, and brought the case to Henry Burgh and Elbridge T. Gerry of The ASPCA. Although it sounds unbelievable today, they had to use animal cruelty laws to rescue Mary Ellen from her abusers. This incredible case clearly showed the great need for child protection laws and advocate agencies, and so on April 27, 1874 The NYSPCC was incorporated.

Among other constraints, lack of mechanization incentives for the farmers, as well as little or no extension work to make it possible for them to farm, has made it difficult for them to produce the volumes needed to achieve food security.
In all these, Kenya, like many other countries, suffers from undernourishment with many families lacking a meal due to abject poverty. This worsens the situation for vulnerable communities who are already struggling to get a meal on their tables.
At Feed the Children, we always advocate for partnerships to be explored, to return the global space on the right track towards the actualization of the 2030 SDGs.

Feed the Children in partnership with donors and beneficiary communities has invested in improving access to water through rooftop water harvesting in schools and construction of water pans. The move brings enormous value to the households, livelihoods, culture, and the environment.
